#Magikarp Pro Tourney#



ELEVATOR PITCH
You are competing to catch the biggest bag! See if you can top the leaderboards by catching the heaviest 5 magikarps from your run!

GAMEPLAY
Design of the game would be a lake background where you have free movement in a boat. Splashes would occur randomly where you would then move towards the splash and be able to catch a magikarp given a certain time frame. You continue to fish to collect the biggest bag of magikarp until your boat runs out of gas. From there you will be placed on a leaderboard to see how you compare/place for a trophy.

vanilla CSS & javascript implementation // try out phaser 3

MVP
render the lake background, boat, splashes
movement for boat (WASD)
give boat finite movement time (gas)
render splashes to occur randomly in lake
randomize weight
trigger catch event: press button near splash to catch fish
record 5 fish data
rank fish bag against leaderboard
save user bag data and record in leaderboard
play again button



STRETCH GOALS
animate catching fish
catch cut scene with weight
provide other catchable objects (different fish, trash)
implement a catch mini game rather than just pressing a button
'cull' lower weighted fish for a bigger bag
optimize weight randomization - make it so heavier weighted fish is harder to catch 
create a red gyrados that ends your game if nearby
